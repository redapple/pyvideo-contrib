{"description": "Learning to code is seen as a new literacy akin to learning a second spoken\nlanguage - but is it? In this talk I'll explore my experiences learning French\nand Python and examine some of the common themes between both fields. Together\nwe'll dismantle the myth that adults cannot learn as well as children and\nexplore what it really means to be _fluent_. Finally, we'll explore immersion\nbased learning and look at how it might help us become better Python\nprogrammers.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": "http://video-pyconfr2015.paulla.asso.fr/011%20-%20Nicole%20Harris%20-%20Learning%20Python,%20Learning%20French.mp4", "video_webm_url": "http://video-pyconfr2015.paulla.asso.fr/011%20-%20Nicole%20Harris%20-%20Learning%20Python,%20Learning%20French.webm", "duration": 1903, "category": "PyCon FR 2015", "speakers": ["Nicole Harris"], "video_ogv_url": "http://video-pyconfr2015.paulla.asso.fr/011%20-%20Nicole%20Harris%20-%20Learning%20Python,%20Learning%20French.ogv", "language": "French", "title": "Learning Python, Learning French", "summary": "In this talk, Nicole explores her experience of learning French and Python \"en\nm\u00eame temps\" and asks the question: What can the Python community learn from\nthe language learning community?\n\n", "state": 2, "thumbnail_url": "http://video-pyconfr2015.paulla.asso.fr/011%20-%20Nicole%20Harris%20-%20Learning%20Python,%20Learning%20French.mp4.jpg"}
