{"description": "When you need to extract data from web pages, you usually parse HTML documents\ninto a DOM tree and then use libraries like BeautifulSoup or the ElementTree\nAPI to extract data from it. Some libraries also support XPath expressions\nwhich can express more complex traversal and search patterns.\n\nEverything about XPath 1.0 is defined in W3C lengthly specification but it can\nbe obscure to read at first. The basics are quite simple to grasp though, and\nthis talk will go over the most useful syntax patterns you need to get\nstarted.\n\nWhat we'll cover: \\- axes and how to look for specific tags, parent element,\nchildren or siblings nodes \\- predicates and selecting nodes based on\nattribute or content values \\- built-in string functions that you should know\nabout \\- EXSLT extensions supported by lxml and how they can solve tricky\nlookups\n\nWe'll end the talk with a few handy tips: \\- how to use CSS selectors to do\nsome of the above \\- how to parse Javascript code with XPath\n\n", "video_mp4_url": "http://video-pyconfr2015.paulla.asso.fr/213%20-%20Paul%20TREMBERTH%20-%20XPath%20for%20web%20scraping.mp4", "source_url": "http://video-pyconfr2015.paulla.asso.fr/213_-_Paul_TREMBERTH_-_XPath_for_web_scraping.html", "video_webm_url": "http://video-pyconfr2015.paulla.asso.fr/213%20-%20Paul%20TREMBERTH%20-%20XPath%20for%20web%20scraping.webm", "duration": 1741, "category": "PyCon FR 2015", "speakers": ["Paul TREMBERTH"], "video_ogv_url": "http://video-pyconfr2015.paulla.asso.fr/213%20-%20Paul%20TREMBERTH%20-%20XPath%20for%20web%20scraping.ogv", "language": "French", "title": "XPath for web scraping", "recorded": "2015-10-17", "summary": "All you need to know about XPath 1.0 in a web scraping project: the different\naxes, attribute matching, string functions, EXSLT extensions plus a few other\nhandy patterns like CSS selectors and Javascript parsing.\n\n", "state": 2, "thumbnail_url": "http://video-pyconfr2015.paulla.asso.fr/213%20-%20Paul%20TREMBERTH%20-%20XPath%20for%20web%20scraping.mp4.jpg"}
